## Introduction
[Enthusiast](https://upsidelab.io/tools/enthusiast) is an open-source toolkit for building AI-powered agentic workflows. It provides tools like Retrieval-Agumented Generation (RAG), vector search and workflow orchestrator. You can connect it to cloud-based models, like OpenAI, as well as self-hosted deployments of Mistral, LLaMA or Deepseek.

Enthusiast helps you cut down time, cost and complexity when building AI-powered tools with customized agents - for smart information search, customer support, content generation or knowledge base automation. Enthusiast provides validation and evaluation components, to reduce hallucinations and ensure responses are grounded in actual data.

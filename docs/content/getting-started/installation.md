# Installation

The quickest way to start using Enthusiast is with the provided Docker Compose setup. This will get you a working instance in just a few minutes.

## Setting Up Using Docker Compose

First, clone the starter repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/upsidelab/enthusiast-starter
$ cp config/env.sample config/env
```

The default configuration uses the OpenAI API for generating document embeddings and for the large language model. 
Make sure that your OpenAI has access to gpt-4.1 it is default recommended model if not - at least gpt-4o to ensure proper functioning of the application.
You need to provide your OpenAI API key via the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable in the `config/env` file.

Next, run Docker Compose to start the environment:

```bash
$ docker compose build && docker compose up
```

## Accessing the Admin Panel

Once the setup is complete, you can access the application UI at [http://localhost:10001](http://localhost:10001).
